    <h2>Who Does This Affect?</h2>
    <h3>There are 4 types of people who have the most risk to identity theft.</h3>
    <p>1. Children: Young children are more at risk to identity theft because not only do they have poor awareness to security but they also have a "clean slate" so to speak when it comes to applying for credit cards and mortgages.</p>
    <p>2. Social Media Users: People who post everyday about thier social life are higher at risk to identity theft because of how exposed they are to the public.</p>
   <p> 3. High Income Users: People who have more money tend to spend more and have more credit cards which leaves more of a digital footprint.</p>
   <p> 4. Elderly: The elderly are less aware to identity theft which makes them more targeted for scams and may have a higher net worth.</p>
